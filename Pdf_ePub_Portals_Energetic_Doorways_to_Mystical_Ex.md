Overview
Connect to Sacred Power Places A portal is a point of possibility, a step into a thousand journeys. Join leading researcher Freddy Silva as he takes you on a magical tour around the world to places on the land where the laws of physics behave differently and the perception of overlapping realities is both apparent and immediate. Experience Cadair Idris in Wales, Tintagel in England, the west coast of Scotland, Kura Tawhiti in New Zealand, TsÃ© Bit&#039;a&#039;Ã­ in New Mexico, the plateau of Giza, and power places high in the Andes. Learn the meaning and origins of the green man, serpents, dragons, and the Shining Ones, and identify the markers for the earth&#039;s telluric currents to find your own places of power. The experience of two worlds makes you present in both but bound to neither. Step out of the cocoon and dabble in a parallel reality as Freddy Silva and our sacred storytellers share their mystical interactions with portals, including those of: - a writer led by a mysterious hum in the Wudang Mountains - a woman who was changed by her experience at Skellig Michael - a mother who connected with mothers both past and future at Bandelier - a traveler who experienced a tear in the fabric of time at Machu Picchu - a woman who bore witness to the living Spirit at Newgrange Enhance your personal mystical experiences as Freddy shares how to interact directly with portals. Understand how to properly approach a portal and the importance of your expectations, timing, respect, and sympathetic resonance. Utilize this knowledge to access these powerful energetic doorways between worlds. PORTALS is your opening in space and time to multiple levels of reality. PORTALS: Energetic Doorways to Mystical Experiences Between Worlds is part of Common Sentience, an uncommon book series that brings the mystical into the mainstream by sharing spiritual wisdom, practices, and true, personal stories of the mystical experiences many are having.
