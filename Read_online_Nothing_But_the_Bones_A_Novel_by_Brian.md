Overview
With lyrical prose and hard-hitting depictions of the hardscrabble life in the rural south, Brian Panowich, author of Bull Mountain, Like Lions, and Hard Cash Valley, delivers a gripping new chapter in his tales of McFalls County in Nothing But the Bones.
 
 In McFalls County, local crime boss Gareth Burroughs runs everything on the mountain. And Nelson ‚ÄúNails‚Äù McKenna has been his enforcer since he was a teenager, though his heart&#039;s not really in the dirty work. Then one night in a local roadhouse, Nails goes too far, defending a woman, and even Burroughs‚Äôs reach can‚Äôt get him out of this one. With a dead body and countless witnesses, Nails and the woman become fugitives on the run, and unlikely partners.
 
 But on the road to Jacksonville, where a possible escape awaits, there‚Äôs more than one interested party on the pair‚Äôs trail, and the glimpse they had of getting away scot free suddenly seems elusive. In the end, Nails must make one final stand for his freedom‚Äîor pay with both of their lives.
