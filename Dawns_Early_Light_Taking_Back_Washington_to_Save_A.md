Overview
With a Foreword by J.D. Vance Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts outlines a peaceful &quot;Second American Revolution&quot; for voters looking to shift the power back into the hands of the people. America is on the brink of destruction. A corrupt and incompetent elite has uprooted our way of life and is brainwashing the next generation. Many so-called conservatives are as culpable as their progressive counterparts. In this ambitious and provocative book, Heritage Foundation President Dr. Kevin Roberts announces the arrival of a New Conservative Movement. His message is simple: Global elites â€” your time is up. Dawnâ€™s Early Light blazes a promising path for the American people to take back their country. Chapter by chapter, it identifies institutions that conservatives need to build, others that we need to take back, and more still that are too corrupt to save: Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, BlackRock, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy, to name a few. All these need to be dissolved if the American way of life is to be passed down to future generations. The good news is, weâ€™re going to win. The Swamp is so drunk on power that the elites don&#039;t realize the ground is moving beneath their feet. In Washington, they wear foreign flags on their lapels, but they donâ€™t protect our border. They wave around the Constitution, but they donâ€™t respect its wisdom. They appeal to Reagan, but Reagan would never put up with this non-sense. Their decadence will be their downfall. A new day is here.
