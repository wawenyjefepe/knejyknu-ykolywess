Overview
Meet Todd. He is thirty-three years old, but also seven, and he loves movies. Todd has the mind of a seven-year-old, and he always will. A childhood accident left Todd stunted, without the ability to express himself clearly, and only one person truly understands him. God.â€‹ The Almighty speaks to Todd and gives him a mission: to repair the broken relationships of his friends and family. In a small town ripped apart by tragedy and violence, God uses Todd, the most unlikely of heroes. God and Todd spans the imagination and faith of a boy who never grew up as he confronts the deep questions of his existence: movies, comics, King Arthur, American society, religion, broken dreams, his purpose to the people in his orbit, and of course, his relationship with God.
